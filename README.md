Web Vulnerability Scanner


1.	Overview
This is a Python based web vulnerability scanner tool that helps in identifying potential weaknesses and threats in web applications and servers. It performs open port scanning, detects common vulnerabilities, and analyses loopholes or misconfigurations that could expose a system to threats. This tool has been designed with a simple command-line interface (CLI) to facilitate ease of use and automatically generate a structured HTML report summarizing all its findings which can be further used for advanced analysing. Its primary goal is to provide learners, researchers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts with hands-on experience in understanding how vulnerabilities are detected and reported during security assessments.
